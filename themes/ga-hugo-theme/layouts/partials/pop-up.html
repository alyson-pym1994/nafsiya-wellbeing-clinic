      <h2>POST TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) & COMPLEX PTSD</h2>
      <p>Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that can occur after someone experiences or witnesses a traumatic event. It is marked by symptoms such as flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety, and emotional numbness. People with PTSD often avoid reminders of the trauma and may feel constantly on edge, which can interfere with daily life and relationships.</p>
      <p>Complex PTSD (C-PTSD) develops from prolonged or repeated trauma, such as ongoing abuse or captivity. In addition to symptoms of PTSD, C-PTSD includes emotional dysregulation, feelings of worthlessness, and difficulties in forming healthy relationships. Those with C-PTSD may also struggle with a persistent sense of shame or guilt, and treatment often involves long-term therapy to address the trauma and its psychological effects.</p>
