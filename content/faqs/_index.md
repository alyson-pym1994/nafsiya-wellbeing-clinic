## Here are some frequently asked questions to help provide clarity and support as you navigate our services.

### What do I need before my appointment?
Prior to attending your appointment, it is important to ensure that you complete any intake documentation that the staff request, send through any documentations from your GP, insurance companies or other services you may be involved with. If you have any prior reports, or anything that could aid your session then let admin know or bring with you to the appointment. 

### What happens if I cannot attend my appointment?
You need to contact the clinic to inform if you cannot attend your appointment or need to reschedule, you can do this via message/email or call. Failure to show to a session may be followed with a cost associated to the session time. You will receive a reminder message prior to your appointment, simply respond to that reminder or contact the clinic to avoid any costs associated. 

### What happens to my personal information?
The clinic utilizes a data system that is in alignment with the medical sector, we follow strict confidentiality guidelines and ensure that data is managed effectively. We store all information into the system to be utilized by the clinic and practitioner. No information is shared without prior consent, we do not share information with third parties. Only members of the clinic are allowed access to the system. If you have any concerns, please contact the clinic or speak to your practitioner. 

### What do I do if I would like to be referred to a different clinician?
You have the right to choose your clinician, if you would like to be referred to another clinician, that clinician would need to have a new referral from your GP which you could consult with. Your practitioner could support you with this process. Please let the clinic know to ensure that your file is completed and closed to avoid further contact if that is your wish. 

### How long does the session last?
Sessions are generally 50 minutes depending on needs, assessments may take longer to complete which would be explained by your practitioner. Please ensure that you arrive on time to your session, as sessions cannot be extended to avoid clash with next appointments.
